# React + TypeScript + Vite

Built with Vite.

To run the application type the following commands

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What I learned

I have created a simple CI/CD pipeline with the help of github actions which runs the test with every Pull request created. This way I am sure I havent broke the app while adding more functionality. Also in the configuration I have blocked direct pushes to master which forces the developer to create a PR.

Previously I have used only yup. Zod is a better way how to handle validation. There is many options and you can infere types from the schema.

A very handy methos are refine and superRefine.
